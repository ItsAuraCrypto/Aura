# Aura Core  

Aura Core is the foundational blockchain system for the **Aura project**, designed specifically for large-scale transactions and high-performance devices. It employs advanced consensus mechanisms and cutting-edge technologies to ensure scalability, security, and environmental responsibility.  

## 🌟 Key Features  

1. **Hybrid Consensus Mechanism**: Combines:
   - **Proof of Work (PoW)** for enhanced network security.
   - **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to minimize environmental impact.
   - Future advanced systems to further strengthen the network.  

2. **Hardware Verification System**:  
   - Devices must pass a **hardware test** to qualify for mining.
   - Ensures only powerful devices can participate in Aura Core, boosting network security and performance.  

3. **Dynamic Load Balancing**:  
   - Optimally allocates resources based on device capacity.  
   - Gaps in the network are filled dynamically, akin to server load management.  

4. **Developer-Friendly**:  
   - Fully open-source and accessible via GitHub.  
   - Encourages global collaboration to improve and expand the system.  

5. **High Scalability & Low Fees**:  
   - Supports large transactions with low gas fees.  
   - Designed to handle high transaction throughput (TPS).  

6. **Environmentally Conscious**:  
   - Balanced PoW and PoS usage reduces global warming and energy consumption.

## 💻 Minimum Hardware Requirements  

To ensure high performance and network security, the following hardware specifications are required:  

- **Processor**: Minimum 8-core CPU.  
- **Graphics**: Minimum 4 GB VRAM, DirectX 12 compatible.  
- **Memory**: 16 GB RAM or higher.  
- **Storage**: 512 GB SSD with at least 256 GB available.  
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (500 Mbps or higher).  

> Devices below these specifications will not be able to mine Aura Core.

## ⚡ How It Works  

### 1. **Mining**  
- Mining is accessible only to high-performance devices.  
- Rewards are distributed based on a hybrid mechanism:  
  - **50% PoW**: For transaction validation and security.  
  - **50% PoS**: For staking and contributing to network sustainability.  

### 2. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**  
- Devices are assessed for their processing power, and space is allocated proportionally.  
- Underutilized resources are redistributed dynamically to maximize efficiency.  

### 3. **Decentralization**  
- Fully decentralized with no central authority.  
- Voting systems (DV & UV) enable users and developers to decide on major changes.  

### 4. **Security**  
- Prevents 51% attacks through additional security layers like **PST** and **POA**.  
- All transactions are encrypted and recorded immutably on the blockchain.
