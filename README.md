# Aura Core

**Aura Core** is the foundational blockchain system for the **Aura project**, designed specifically for large-scale transactions and high-performance devices. It employs advanced consensus mechanisms and cutting-edge technologies to ensure scalability, security, and environmental responsibility.

## üåü Key Features

1. **Hybrid Consensus Mechanism**: Combines:  
   - **Proof of Work (PoW)** for enhanced network security.  
   - **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to minimize environmental impact.  

2. **Optimized Participation**:  
   - Devices must meet a specific **hardware standard** to maintain network stability and security.  
   - Ensures a high-quality and efficient blockchain environment.  

3. **Dynamic Load Balancing**:  
   - Optimally allocates resources based on device capacity.  
   - Gaps in the network are filled dynamically, akin to server load management.  

4. **Developer-Friendly**:  
   - Fully open-source and accessible via GitHub.  
   - Encourages global collaboration to improve and expand the system.  

5. **High Scalability & Low Fees**:  
   - Supports large transactions with low gas fees.  
   - Designed to handle high transaction throughput (TPS).  

6. **Environmentally Conscious**:  
   - Balanced PoW and PoS usage reduces global warming and energy consumption.

## üíª Minimum Hardware Requirements

To ensure high performance and network security, the following hardware specifications are recommended:

- **Processor**: Minimum 4-core CPU, 2 GHz or higher.  
- **Graphics**: Minimum 2 GB VRAM, DirectX 12 compatible or equivalent.  
- **Memory**: 8 GB RAM or higher.  
- **Storage**: 128 GB SSD with at least 64 GB available.  
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (minimum 10 Mbps).

> Devices below these specifications can participate through **Aura Lite**.

## ‚ö° How It Works

### 1. **Mining**  
- Mining is accessible to mid-range and high-performance devices.  
- Rewards are distributed based on a hybrid mechanism:  
  - **50% PoW**: For transaction validation and security.  
  - **50% PoS**: For staking and contributing to network sustainability.  

### 2. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**  
- Devices are assessed for their processing power, and space is allocated proportionally.  
- Underutilized resources are redistributed dynamically to maximize efficiency.  

### 3. **Decentralization**  
- Fully decentralized with no central authority.  
- Voting systems enable users and developers to decide on major changes.  

### 4. **Security**  
- Prevents 51% attacks through additional security layers like **PST** and **POA**.  
- All transactions are encrypted and recorded immutably on the blockchain.
