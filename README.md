# Aura Core

Aura Core is the foundational framework of the Aura blockchain, encompassing protocols, mining algorithms, and consensus mechanisms. Designed for security, decentralization, and scalability, Aura Core offers advanced features for mining and blockchain validation.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Aura Core:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItsAuraCrypto/Aura-Core.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Aura-Core


	3.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	4.	Start the blockchain node:

npm start



This will start the node and initialize the mining process. Mined blocks will be validated and stored on the blockchain.

Features

Core Features

	•	Proof-of-Work (PoW): Secure and fair mining algorithm.
	•	Decentralized Validation: Blocks are validated independently by multiple nodes.
	•	Fast Block Validation: Optimized for rapid transaction processing.
	•	Smart Contracts (coming soon): Support for programmable transactions.

## API Documentation

Aura Core provides an API for interacting with the blockchain.

GET /api/blockchain

Retrieve the latest blocks in the blockchain.

Response Example:

{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "block_id": "1",
      "timestamp": "2024-11-20",
      "transactions": [...]
    }
  ]
}

POST /api/transaction

Add a new transaction to the blockchain.

Request Example:

{
  "sender": "address_1",
  "receiver": "address_2",
  "amount": 10
}

Response Example:

{
  "status": "success",
  "transaction_id": "txn_12345"
}
