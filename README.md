# 🌌 Aura Core  

Aura Core is the foundational framework of the Aura blockchain, combining cutting-edge protocols, secure consensus mechanisms, and efficient mining algorithms. Designed for **security**, **decentralization**, and **scalability**, Aura Core lays the groundwork for advanced blockchain validation and transactions.

## 🚀 Features  

### Core Features  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW):** Secure and fair mining algorithm.  
- **Decentralized Validation:** Blocks are validated independently by multiple nodes, ensuring trustless consensus.  
- **Fast Block Validation:** Optimized for high-speed transaction processing.  
- **Smart Contracts (coming soon):** Support for programmable transactions and decentralized applications.  

### API Features  
Aura Core provides a robust RESTful API for interacting with the blockchain:  
- Retrieve blockchain data.  
- Add and validate transactions.  
- Monitor network status.

## 🔧 Prerequisites  

Before setting up the project, ensure the following tools are installed:  

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)  
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)  
- **Python** (for testing and development tools)

## 📥 Installation  

Follow these steps to set up and run Aura Core:  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ItsAuraCrypto/Aura-Core.git
   cd Aura-Core

	2.	Install Dependencies:

npm install


	3.	Start the Blockchain Node:

npm start

This will initialize the blockchain and begin mining blocks. Mined blocks are validated and added to the blockchain.

## 📦 API Documentation

      "transactions": [
        {
          "transaction_id": "txn_123",
          "sender": "address_1",
          "receiver": "address_2",
          "amount": 100
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

POST /api/transaction

Add a new transaction to the blockchain.

Request Example:

{
  "sender": "address_1",
  "receiver": "address_2",
  "amount": 10
}

Response Example:

{
  "status": "success",
  "transaction_id": "txn_12345"
}
