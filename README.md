## üåü Key Features

1. **Hybrid Consensus Mechanism**:
   - Combines **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)** for high security and sustainability.

2. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - Accessible to moderately powerful devices for mining and participation.

3. **Dynamic Load Balancing**:
   - Resources are allocated based on device capacity, ensuring efficiency.

4. **Developer-Friendly**:
   - Fully open-source and accessible via GitHub to encourage global collaboration.

5. **High Scalability & Low Fees**:
   - Supports large transactions with low gas fees and high transaction throughput.

6. **Decentralization**:
   - Ensures fair participation and network governance with community voting.

## üíª Minimum Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: Quad-core CPU (e.g., Intel i5 or Ryzen 3).
- **Graphics**: Integrated graphics or discrete GPU with 2 GB VRAM.
- **Memory**: 8 GB RAM or higher.
- **Storage**: 256 GB SSD with at least 128 GB available.
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (10 Mbps or higher).

## ‚ö° How It Works

### 1. Mining
- Accessible to moderately powerful devices.
- Rewards distributed through a hybrid system:
  - **PoW (50%)**: For validating transactions.
  - **PoS (50%)**: For staking and sustainability.

### 2. Resource Allocation
- Dynamically assesses device capacity and allocates resources proportionally.

### 3. Decentralization
- Implements a fair voting system for decision-making and upgrades.

### 4. Security
- Prevents attacks through advanced algorithms like **PST** and **POA**.
- Transactions are encrypted and immutably stored on the blockchain.
