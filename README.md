# Aura Core

Aura Core is the foundational framework of the Aura blockchain, providing protocols, mining algorithms, and consensus mechanisms. It is designed for security, decentralization, and scalability, offering core features for mining, validation, and blockchain management.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run Aura Core:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItsAuraCrypto/Aura-Core.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Aura-Core


	3.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	4.	Start the blockchain node:

npm start

This will initialize the blockchain node and begin the mining process. Mined blocks will be validated and stored on the blockchain.

Features

Core Features:

	•	Proof-of-Work (PoW): A secure and fair mining algorithm.
	•	Decentralized Validation: Independent validation of blocks by multiple nodes.
	•	Optimized Transactions: Faster block validation and transaction processing.
	•	Smart Contracts (coming soon): Support for programmable blockchain interactions.

API Endpoints

Aura Core provides the following APIs for interaction with the blockchain:

GET /api/blockchain

Retrieves the latest blocks in the blockchain.

Response Example:

{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "block_id": "1",
      "timestamp": "2024-11-22",
      "transactions": [...]
    }
  ]
}

POST /api/transaction

Adds a new transaction to the blockchain.

Request Example:

{
  "sender": "address_1",
  "receiver": "address_2",
  "amount": 10
}

Response Example:

{
  "status": "success",
  "transaction_id": "txn_12345"
}

More endpoints and details will be added as development progresses.
